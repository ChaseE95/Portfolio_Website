            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Chase Ellis and i am a new Software Developer. I intend to start a carreer working with software, with the end goal of
                being a back end developer. My skills include limited python (I've mostly worked with basic algorithms and beginner concepts), Web 
                and front end software development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), i also spent a year self teaching penetration testing but unfortunatly 
                due to some financial and preparedness issues failed to recieve my certification. In addition to all this i have about a years 
                worth of managment experience including book-keeping and scheduling as well as day to day handling of crew and operations.
            </p>

                My work experience consists of kitchens, i started as line cook at a fast food restaraunt and within three years was the assistant
                general manager, I then left and became a prep-cook in a higher end restaraunt in my home town and there i remain. In honesty bad
                experience with this type of work has driven my descision to do something more with my life, but all of this has shown me a simple 
                fact about myself, set me a task and i do everything in my power to be the best at it, and so far, i've succeeded in that.

                In my free time I enjoy fishing, hiking, learning both useful and useless information and playing video games, i also love to read 
                and write though i usually keep my writing to myself.
