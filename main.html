            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Chase Ellis and i am a new Software Developer. I intend to start a carreer devolping software, with an end goal of
                being a back end developer. My skills include limited python (I've mostly worked with basic algorithms and beginner concepts), Web 
                and front end sof&ware development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), i also spent a year self teaching penetration testing but unfortunatly 
                due to some financial issues failed to recieve my certification. In addition to all this i have about a years worth of managment 
                experience including book-keeping and scheduling as well as day to day handling of crew and operations. Other work experience is 
                consists of kitchen work (prep cook, line cook etc.) but i am ready to build a new skill set and change my lifestyle.
